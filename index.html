    <section id="about-me">
        <p>
          I’m an INTP—if you know, you know. By day, I’m a programme manager, guiding 
          teams through complex organisational transformation with a focus on planning and 
          collaborative problem-solving. By night, I’m a maker, blending creativity, lifestyle 
          design and logic with a systems theory lens. Whether it’s coding, 3D printing, brewing beer, 
          or diving into DIY electronics, I’m driven by the philosophical ideals of the polymath and 
          renaissance man—pursuing diverse skills to solve complex problems holistically.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest in full-stack development began with my journey into self-hosting to regain 
          digital sovereignty. This hands-on experience introduced me to backend architecture, 
          service deployment, and digital infrastructure. Building on this foundation, I now create 
          web apps that are seamless, user-friendly, and above all else, practical.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m passionate about building lean, sustainable solutions that empower others and reduce 
          environmental impact. Whether automating tasks or designing modular tools, I strive to 
          apply the polymath's approach—bridging disciplines to create technology that works smarter 
          and more sustainably for everyone.

          <p class="blog-content">
            Last year, I grew tired of relying on faceless corporations to control my digital life. 
            My data felt like it was floating aimlessly in the ether—perfectly good services would 
            shut down without warning, prices would skyrocket once they had you hooked, and security 
            breaches seemed all too common... who has time to wade through those endless privacy 
            policies and T&Cs? The never-ending subscription fees felt like throwing away hard-earned money.

            This spring, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I won an auction for a retired 
            enterprise Dell PowerEdge R730 server—cheaper than an off-the-shelf NAS and far more 
            powerful, albeit a bit noisier! Before long, I had fully committed to self-hosting, and it’s 
            been an incredibly rewarding journey ever since.
            
            Now, I run a Proxmox server at home that virtualises as many linux servers as I need, and they  
            host everything from my media library and network shares to a Git instance and workstation backups.
            It’s become my digital fortress, and I absolutely love it.

            <strong>What is this 'Digital Sovereignty'?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            Digital sovereignty, in essence, is the notion of reclaiming control over your data and online 
            experiences. Instead of relying on centralised services, you manage your own systems, 
            retaining autonomy over your information and digital footprint. It's about knowing where 
            your data resides, how it's being used, and taking agency over your technology. If you like 
            to tinker, there's plenty to keep you entertained, and if you like things simple, well, stick 
            to the default settings!

            <strong>The Rewards of Self-Hosting</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
            Let's talk about why self-hosting is so appealing.
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          <strong>Financial Freedom: Ditching the Subscriptions</strong>
            <br>
            One of the most tangible benefits is the cost savings. I was tired of paying monthly for 
            cloud storage, media streaming, and other services.  With self-hosting, I've replaced 
            many of these with fantastic free and open-source alternatives. Instead of paying for 
            cloud storage, for example, I now use Nextcloud to manage my files on my own server.  
            The savings can add up significantly over time. Sure, in my case, I did make some upfront 
            purchases, but I did the maths, it will pay for itself in 12 months, and then I'm reaping 
            rewards. Of course, you don't need fancy hardware, you can run a server on an old laptop, 
            or salvaged e-waste destined for landfill, just be sure you factor in energy costs to your 
            calculations when choosing old hardware, as it can be less efficient, but old hardware can 
            still make sense, so don't discount it.
        </p>
        
            <p class="blog-content">
          <strong>Enhanced Privacy and Control: Your Data, Your Rules</strong>
              <br>  
              Beyond cost savings, the enhanced control over my data is invaluable.  I decide how I 
              store my information and who has access to it, how long I keep it for, and there's no risk 
              of losing it when the corporation decides to pull the plug. I don't have to worry about privacy 
              breaches with large corporations. For example, using Jellyfin for media streaming 
              provides a private and customisable experience compared to commercial services. If I 
              want to share my files outside my home network, I can setup a reverse proxy with 
              WireGuard and tunnel in securely, reaching my files from anywhere on the planet, and share them 
              with whom I choose! I don't have to follow arbitrary rules on how many users can access my services, and no one is hoovering up data on my hobbies and interests.
            </p>

            <strong>An Endless Learning Opportunity:  Skills that Matter</strong>
              <br>
            Self-hosting isn’t just about saving money; it’s about learning. Setting up my own 
            servers has been an education in itself. I've gained invaluable skills in command line, UNIX,
            networking, system administration, security and firewalls, and configuration management.  
            These are skills that translate well into many areas of technology, and I love the challenge of learning more 
            every single day, because there's always something to add to my swiss army knife of services.

            <strong>Taking Back Your Digital Life</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            Self-hosting isn’t a gimmick; it's a path to a more independent and 
            empowered digital life.  By diving in, you can achieve digital sovereignty, reduce 
            recurring costs, and acquire valuable skills. You have the power to take control of your 
            data, learn about the technology you depend on, and break free from the grip of 
            centralised services.
