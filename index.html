                    <p class="text-gray-500 mb-8">Published: 9th December 2024, 14:30</p>
                    <div class="prose max-w-none">
                        <p class="mb-6">Last year, I resolved to stop giving away my data so freely. Like many others, I had been swept up in the cloud-based streaming and service revolution of the 2010s. As an early adopter, I quickly abandoned traditional methods of listening to music or storing family photos in favour of convenient, pay-per-month subscriptions. Yet, being an early adopter often means I’m also an early leaver. It began to feel as though my life was floating aimlessly in the digital ether.</p>

                        <p class="mb-6">Every so often, a perfectly good service would shut down without warning, or introductory prices that once seemed reasonable would skyrocket once I was locked in. Then there were the prying eyes, data mining—and honestly, who has the time to sift through endless privacy policies and terms & conditions? The mounting subscription fees began to feel like I was throwing away my hard-earned money.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-6">This spring, I decided to take matters into my own hands, literally... I won an ebay auction for a retired enterprise server—cheaper than an off-the-shelf NAS, with 8 HDD bays, 192GB RAM and 2 CPUs, the thing is a beast. It wasn't long until I had fully committed to self-hosting and it's been an incredibly rewarding journey ever since.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-6">Now, I run a Proxmox server in my homelab, which virtualises as many Linux servers as I need, quickly spinning up new instances whenever the mood strikes and testing out different configurations. These servers host everything from my media library and network shares to a Git instance and workstation backups. It’s become my digital fortress, and I absolutely love it.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What is 'Digital Sovereignty' and why should I care?</h5>
                        <p class="mb-6">Digital sovereignty, in essence, is the notion of reclaiming control over your data, storage and media. Instead of relying on centralised services, you manage your own systems, retaining autonomy over your information and digital footprint. It's about knowing where your data resides, how it's being used and taking agency over your technology. If you like to tinker, there's plenty to keep you entertained and if you like things simple, well, stick to the default settings!</p>

                        <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Rewards of Self-Hosting</h5>
                        <p class="mb-6">Let's talk about why self-hosting is so appealing.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Financial Freedom: Ditching the Subscriptions</h5>
                        <p class="mb-6">One of the most tangible benefits has been the cost savings. I grew tired of paying monthly for cloud storage, media streaming, and other services. With self-hosting, I've replaced many of these with fantastic free and open-source alternatives. For example, instead of paying for cloud storage, I now use Nextcloud to manage my files on my own server. The savings really add up over time. Sure, I made some upfront purchases, but I did the maths: it will pay for itself in 12 months, and after that, I’ll be reaping the rewards.</p>

                        <p class="mb-6">Of course, you don't need fancy hardware—you can run a server on an old laptop or salvaged e-waste destined for the landfill. Just make sure to factor in energy costs when choosing older hardware, as it can be less efficient. However, old hardware can still make sense, so don’t discount it.</p>
                            
                        <p class="mb-6">One thing that often gets overlooked is acquiring your own media, and it’s important to do so ethically. Remember, if you're streaming from a service, you never truly own the content. Stop paying, and you're out in the cold—no access, nada, zilch! That’s what makes the leap to 100% self-hosting so challenging. I kept my Spotify account running for a couple of months before eventually switching to free ad-supported model, so I can still listen to new tracks, or stuff that hasn't made it to my personal library yet, the FOMO is real there.</p>
                            
                        <p class="mb-6">Personally, I tend to listen to the same few albums and watch classic movies, many of which I can pick up second-hand for next to nothing. Once you consider the savings, the occasional CD or DVD purchase won’t break the bank, and you'll likely still come out ahead. Here are some typical savings:</p>

                        <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Enhanced Privacy and Control: Your Data, Your Rules</h5>
                        <p class="mb-6">Beyond cost savings, the enhanced control over my data is invaluable. I decide how I store my information and who or how many people can access to it, how long I keep it for and there's no risk of losing it when the corporation decides to pull the plug. I don't have to worry about privacy breaches with large corporations. For example, using Jellyfin for media streaming provides a private and customisable experience compared to commercial services. If I want to share my files outside my home network, I can setup a reverse proxy with WireGuard and tunnel in securely, reaching my files from anywhere on the planet and share them with whom I choose! I don't have to follow arbitrary rules on how many users can access my services and no one is hoovering up data on my hobbies and interests.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">An Endless Learning Opportunity: Skills that Matter</h5>
                        <p class="mb-6">Self-hosting isn't just about saving money; it's about learning. Setting up my own servers has been an education in itself. I've gained invaluable skills in command line, UNIX, networking, system administration, security and firewalls and configuration management. These are skills that translate well into many areas of technology and I love the challenge of learning more every single day, because there's always something to add to my swiss army knife of services.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Taking Back Your Digital Life</h5>
                        <p class="mb-6">Self-hosting isn't a gimmick; it's a path to a more independent and empowered digital life. By diving in, you can achieve digital sovereignty, reduce recurring costs and acquire valuable skills. You have the power to take control of your data, learn about the technology you depend on and break free from the grip of centralised services.</p>

                        <p class="mb-6">Are you ready to start exploring the world of self-hosting? Take back control, build new skills and start your journey today.</p>
